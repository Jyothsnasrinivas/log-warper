1.7.2
=====

* [#57](https://github.com/serokell/log-warper/issues/57):
  Add `Exception` module with `logException` and `catchLog` functions.
* [#60](https://github.com/serokell/log-warper/issues/60):
  Fix documentation for `termSeveritiesOut` and `termSeveritiesErr`.

1.7.1
=====

* Bump `containers` to version `0.5.10`.

1.7.0
=====

* [#48](https://github.com/serokell/log-warper/issues/48):
  Output for severities is now configured in config file with `termSeveritiesOut`
  and `termSeveritiesErr` for writing into `stdout` and `stderr` accordingly.
  Default behavior: `Errors` into `stderr`, all other into `stdout`.
* In yaml config file added new keywords for dealing with `Severities`:
  'All' -- all severities, 'X+' -- severities greater or equal to X.
* Changed .yaml format: logger severity receives set of severities (`Severities`).
* [#32](https://github.com/serokell/log-warper/issues/32):
  Changed .yaml format: `LoggerTree` should be written under 'loggerTree:'.

* Some space leaks elimination:
  + The `MemoryQueue` has been partially reworked to get rid of the "inline" State manipulation;
  + Strings have been dropped almost everywhere in favour of `Text`;
  + A `LogFormatter` has been reworked to yield a `IO Builder`;
  + `replaceVarM` has been reworked to be pure _and_ to work with builders rather than plain Text/Strings;
